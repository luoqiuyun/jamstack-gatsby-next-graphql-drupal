Don't run until all of the ingredients have been added,Add to this; the beetroot, chickpeas, 1 tablespoon of tahini, the breadcrumbs and the egg.,Blitz to a rough consistency, don't over-blend. Aim for some texture, not babyfood.,Ideally, leave the mixture to rest for 30 minutes or more before cooking to allow the breadcrumbs to rehydrate a little,Using you hands, form into about 20 golf-ball sized balls and them flatten into patties.  A great tip from Jamie Oliver's 15 minutes meals, when moulding falafels is to wet your hands first.  This prevents the gooey mixture from sticking to your hands.,Gently shallow fry for 15 to 20 minutes until crusted and caramelised on the outside.,Meanwhile, slice the halloumi width-wise into about 10 slices, spray with olive oil and griddle until nicely toasted - it won't melt.,Mix a tablespoon or so of the tahini into the yogurt, season and mix well to serve as a dip.","relationships":{"category":{"name":"Starter"},"image":{"relationships":{"imageFile":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3409090909090908,"src":"/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/53576/1192803-pxhere.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/7b9c2/1192803-pxhere.jpg 118w,\n/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/d9785/1192803-pxhere.jpg 235w,\n/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/53576/1192803-pxhere.jpg 470w,\n/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/3e89c/1192803-pxhere.jpg 705w,\n/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/94a4d/1192803-pxhere.jpg 940w,\n/static/4af8301c1f6a72477ac8ac8c80ec2a7b/9e346/1192803-pxhere.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px"}}}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"33260d3b-e7cb-5826-9b49-fc8331cd3c07","title":"Beetroot falafel with toasted halloumi cheese","__params":{"title":"beetroot-falafel-with-toasted-halloumi-cheese"}}},
